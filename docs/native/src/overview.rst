If you deliver a iOS-based experience that allows your users to store Office files or includes Office files as a key part of your solution, you now have the opportunity to integrate |Office iOS| into your experience. This integration works directly against files stored by you. Your users won't need a separate storage solution to view and edit Office files.

Editing and viewing Office files
--------------------------------
When you integrate with |Office iOS|, your users can view and edit Excel, PowerPoint, and Word files directly on the iOS device. The level of editing support is determined by the type of user and whether they have an O365 subscription. 

Integration process
-------------------

You can use the Web Application Open Platform Interface (WOPI) protocol to integrate |Office iOS| with your application. The WOPI protocol enables |Office iOS| to access and change files that are stored in your service.

To integrate your application with |Office iOS|, you need to do the following:
 #. Become a member of theÂ Office 365 - Cloud Storage Partner Program. You can learn more about the program, as well as how to apply, at `Office 365 Cloud Storage Partner Program. <http://dev.office.com/programs/officecloudstorage>`_
 #. Provide the required on-boarding information as described in the section titled :ref:`Onboarding information <onboarding>`.
 #. Obtain your ProviderId and app store URLs from Microsoft. The app store URLs are the URLs you should use to launch Office on a platform's app store. 
 #. Add your domain to the WOPI domain :ref:`allow list <allow list>`. This is required even if you do not integrate with |wac| so you can verify your WOPI integration with the :ref:`validator app <Validator app>`.
 #. Implement the WOPI protocol. The set of WOPI operations that must be supported is described in the section titled :ref:`WOPI implementation requirements for |Office iOS| integration <requirements>`.
 #. Implement required changes to your app. Contact your |Office iOS| integration contacts to receive directions to run |Office iOS| in test mode, to enable testing. 
 #. Run the :ref:`validator app <Validator app>` and fix any issues until the validator reports a 100% pass rate. 
 #. Complete the manual testing outlined in the :ref:`Manual Validation section <Manual Validation>` to verify the integration works as expected. 
 #. Once all manual test cases have a 100% pass rate, send your Manual Validation :download:`report </testing/ManualTestPass.docx>` and directions to run your validator. 
 #. Once the |Office iOS| team completes their manual testing, they will work with you to schedule your launch date. 
	
Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authentication is handled by passing |Office iOS| an access token that you generate from a Bootstrapper URL. Assign this token a reasonable expiration date. Also, we recommend that tokens be valid for a single user against a single file to help mitigate the risk of token leaks.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* You need to ensure that files are represented by a unique ID. See the full list of :ref:`File ID requirements <Concepts>`.
* You should have a mechanism for identifying file versions. See the :ref:`Version requirements <CheckFileInfo>`.
* In order to integrate with |Office iOS|, there are also a few promotional requirements which include:
   * Promoting |Office iOS| integration somewhere within your app
   * Promoting |Office iOS| integration in the context of editing and viewing Office documents
   * Using Office as the default app for opening Office documents within your app

Security Considerations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|Office iOS| is designed to work for enterprises that have strict security requirements. To make sure your integration is as secure as possible, ensure that:
    * All traffic is SSL encrypted.
    * Server needs to support TLS 1.0+ 
    * OAuth 2.0 is supported
