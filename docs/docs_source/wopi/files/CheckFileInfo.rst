CheckFileInfo
=============

..  default-domain:: http

..  get:: /wopi*/files/(file_id)

    The CheckFileInfo operation is one of the most important WOPI operations. This operation must be implemented
    for all WOPI actions. CheckFileInfo returns information about a file, a user's permissions on that file, and general
    information about the capabilities that the WOPI host has on the file. In addition, some CheckFileInfo properties
    can influence the appearance and behavior of Office Online.

    ..  include:: /fragments/common_params.rst

    :reqheader X-WOPI-SessionContext:
        The value of the :ref:`session context`, if provided on the initial WOPI action URL using the ``sc`` parameter.

    :code 200: Success
    :code 401: Invalid :term:`access token`
    :code 404: File unknown/user unauthorized
    :code 500: Server error

    ..  include:: /fragments/common_headers.rst

Response
--------

The response to a CheckFileInfo call is JSON (as specified in :rfc:`4627`) containing a number of properties, most of
which are optional.

..  include:: /fragments/param_types.rst

Required response properties
----------------------------

The following properties must be present in all CheckFileInfo responses:

..  glossary::

    BaseFileName
        The **string** name of the file without a path. Used for display in user interface (UI), and determining
        the extension of the file. **This is a required value in all CheckFileInfo responses.**

    OwnerId
        A string that uniquely identifies the owner of the file.
        **This is a required value in all CheckFileInfo responses.**

        ..  note::
            This ID is subject to the same uniqueness and consistency requirements as all
            :ref:`User identity properties`.

    Size
        The size of the file in bytes, expressed as a **long**, a 64 bit signed integer.
        **This is a required value in all CheckFileInfo responses.**

    Version
        The current version of the file based on the server's file version schema, as a **string**. This value
        must change when the file changes, and version values must never repeat for a given file.
        **This is a required value in all CheckFileInfo responses.**

        ..  important:: This value must be a **string**.


Other response properties
-------------------------

Some properties require special arrangements with Microsoft in order to be used. These properties are marked
|need_permission|. If you wish to use these properties, you must contact Microsoft and request that the appropriate
settings be adjusted to allow you to use these properties. Otherwise these properties will be ignored.


Navigation URL properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hosts can return a number of URLs that Office Online will navigate to in various scenarios.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    ClientUrl
        A user-accessible URI directly to the file intended for opening the file through a client. Can be a DAV URL
        (:rfc:`5323`), but may be any URL that can be handled by a client that can open a file of the given
        type. If this property is provided, Office Online will display UI allowing users to open the files in the
        applicable client application.

    CloseUrl
        A URI to a web page that Office Online will navigate to when the application closes, or in the event of an
        unrecoverable error. If provided, when the *Close* UI is activated, Office Online will navigate the outer
        page (``window.top.location``) to the URI provided.

        Hosts can also use the :term:`ClosePostMessage` property to indicate a PostMessage should be sent when
        the *Close* UI is activated rather than navigate to a URL, or set the :term:`CloseButtonClosesWindow`
        property to indicate that the *Close* UI should close the browser tab or window (``window.top.close``).

        If the :term:`CloseUrl`, :term:`ClosePostMessage`, and :term:`CloseButtonClosesWindow` properties are all
        omitted, the *Close* UI will be hidden in Office Online.

        ..  note:: The *Close* UI will never be displayed when using the :wopi:action:`embedview` action.

    DownloadUrl
        A user-accessible URI to the file intended to allow the user to download a copy of the file.

    EditAndReplyUrl
        ..  note:: |future|

    FileSharingUrl
        A URI to a location that allows the user to share the file. If provided, when the *Share* UI is activated,
        Office Online will open a new browser window to the URI provided.

        Hosts can also use the :term:`FileSharingPostMessage` property to indicate a PostMessage should be sent when
        the *Share* UI is activated rather than navigate to a URL.

        If neither the :term:`FileSharingUrl` nor the :term:`FileSharingPostMessage` properties are set, the *Share*
        UI will be hidden in Office Online.

    FileUrl
        A URI to the file location that the WOPI client uses to get the file. If this is provided, Office Online
        will use this URI to get the file instead of a :ref:`GetFile` request. A host might set this property if it is
        easier or provides better performance to serve files from a different domain than the one handling standard
        WOPI requests. The FileUrl is used exactly as provided; no other parameters, including the :term:`access token`,
        will be appended to the FileUrl before it is used.

        ..  important::
            The FileUrl is meant as a performance enhancement. The :ref:`GetFile` operation must still be supported
            for the file even when the FileUrl property is provided.

        ..  note::
            Requests to the :term:`FileUrl` will not be signed. The FileUrl is used exactly as provided by the host,
            so it does not necessarily include the access token, which is required to construct the expected proof.


    HostEditUrl
        A URI to the :term:`host page` that loads the :wopi:action:`edit` WOPI action. This URL is used by Office
        Online to navigate between view and edit mode. In addition, the HostEditUrl property contains the URL that is
        stored in the recent documents list if a :term:`ClientUrl` is not provided.

    HostEmbeddedEditUrl
        A URI to a web page that provides access to an editing experience for the file that can be embedded in
        another HTML page. For example, a page that provides an HTML snippet that can be inserted into the HTML of a
        blog.

    HostEmbeddedViewUrl
        A URI to a web page that provides access to a viewing experience for the file that can be embedded in another
        HTML page. For example, a page that provides an HTML snippet that can be inserted into the HTML of a blog.

    HostRestUrl
        A URI that is the base URI for REST operations for the file.

    HostViewUrl
        A URI to the :term:`host page` that loads the :wopi:action:`view` WOPI action. This URL is used by Office
        Online to navigate between view and edit mode.

    PrivacyUrl
        A URI to a webpage that explains the privacy policy of the host.

        ..  deprecated:: 2015.06.01
            This property is now ignored by Office Online.

    SignInUrl
        A URI that will allow the user to sign in using the host's authentication system. This property can be used
        when supporting anonymous users. If this property is not provided, no sign in UI will be shown in Office
        Online.

        ..  seealso:: :term:`SignoutUrl`

    SignoutUrl
        A URI that will sign the current user out of the host's authentication system. If this property is not
        provided, no sign out UI will be shown in Office Online.

        ..  seealso:: :term:`SignInUrl`

    TermsOfUseUrl
        A URI to a webpage that explains the terms of use policy of the host.

        ..  deprecated:: 2015.06.01
            This property is now ignored by Office Online.


..  _supports properties:

WOPI capabilities properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Supports\*** properties indicate to Office Online the WOPI capabilities that the host provides for a file. All
**Supports\*** properties are optional and thus default to ``false``; hosts should set them to ``true`` if their WOPI
implementation meets the requirements for a particular property.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    EditingCannotSave
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports editing files without saving them.

        ..  deprecated:: 2014.06.01
            This property is now ignored by Office Online.

    SupportsCoauth
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports multiple users making changes to this file
        simultaneously. This value must always be ``false``.

        ..  note:: |future|

    SupportsCobalt
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`ExecuteCellStorageRequest` and
        :ref:`ExecuteCellStorageRelativeRequest` operations for this file.

    SupportsExtendedLockLength
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports lock IDs up to 1024 ASCII characters long. If not
        provided, Office Online will assume that lock IDs are limited to 256 ASCII characters.

        ..  important::
            While the 256 ASCII character lock length is currently sufficient, longer lock IDs will likely be
            required to support future scenarios, so we recommend hosts support extended lock lengths as soon as
            possible. See :ref:`lock ID lengths <lock length>` for more information.

    SupportsFileCreation
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports creating new files using Office Online. See
        :ref:`Create New` for more information.

    SupportsFolders
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`CheckFolderInfo`, :ref:`EnumerateChildren`,
        :ref:`DeleteFile` operations for this file. This implies that the host can use :ref:`WOPI actions` that
        require :wopi:req:`containers` support.

    SupportsGetLock
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports the :ref:`GetLock` operation.

    SupportsLocks
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`Lock`, :ref:`Unlock`, :ref:`RefreshLock`, and
        :ref:`UnlockAndRelock` operations for this file. This implies that the host can use :ref:`WOPI actions` that
        require :wopi:req:`locks` support.

    SupportsRename
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`RenameFile` operations for this file.

    SupportsScenarioLinks
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports scenarios where users can operate on files in
        limited ways via restricted URLs.

    SupportsSecureStore
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports calls to a secure data store utilizing credentials
        stored in the file.

    SupportsUpdate
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`PutFile` and :ref:`PutRelativeFile` operations
        for this file.

    SupportsUserInfo
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the host supports :ref:`PutUserInfo` operation for this file.

        ..  versionadded:: 2015.08.03
            Support for this property was added to Office Online on August 3, 2015.



.. _User identity properties:

User identity properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several properties hosts can use to provide user ID data to Office Online. Any ID value in the following
properties must meet the following requirements:

* Unique to a single user. The :term:`TenantId` property is the sole exception to this requirement.
* Consistent over time. For example, if a particular user uses Office Online to view a document on Monday, then
  returns and views another document on Tuesday, the value of the user-related properties should match.

Office Online will record these User ID values, but they will be hashed and encrypted in such a way that their
uniqueness is maintained, but the raw values are not. Hosts can opt to pass values that are already hashed/encrypted
as long as the values meet the criteria above.

User identity properties are not shown in any Office Online UI.

..  seealso:: :term:`OwnerId`

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    HostAuthenticationId
        A **string** value uniquely identifying the user currently accessing the file.

        ..  note::

            This property should not be used. Hosts should use the :term:`UserId` property instead.

    PresenceUserId
        A **string** that identifies the user in the context of the :term:`PresenceProvider`.

        ..  note:: |future|

    TenantId
        A **string** value uniquely identifying the user's 'tenant,' or group/organization to which they belong. This
        property is useful for hosts

        ..  caution::

            The presence of this property does not remove the uniqueness and consistency requirements listed above.
            User properties are expected to be unique *per user* and consistent over time regardless of the presence
            of a :term:`TenantId`.

    UserId
        A **string** value uniquely identifying the user currently accessing the file.

    UserPrincipalName
        A **string** value uniquely identifying the user currently accessing the file.

        ..  note:: |future|


..  _User metadata properties:

User metadata properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the :ref:`User identity properties`, hosts can provide additional user metadata using the following
properties.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    UserFriendlyName
        A **string** that is the name of the user, suitable for displaying in UI. If blank, Office Online will use a
        placeholder string in some scenarios, or show no name at all.

    LicenseCheckForEditIsEnabled
        A **Boolean** value indicating whether the user is a business user or not. This must be set to ``true``
        whenever the user is a business user. See :ref:`Business editing` for more information.

    UserInfo
        A **string** value containing information about the user. This string will be passed from Office Online to
        the host by means of a :ref:`PutUserInfo` operation. If the host has a UserInfo string for the user, they
        must include it in this property. See the :ref:`PutUserInfo` documentation for more details.

        ..  versionadded:: 2015.08.03
            Support for this property was added to Office Online on August 3, 2015.


..  _permissions:

User permissions properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Office Online always assumes that users have limited permissions to documents. If you do not set the appropriate
user permissions properties, users will not be able to perform operations such as editing documents in Office Online.

Ultimately, the host has final control over whether WOPI operations attempted by Office Online should succeed or fail
based on the :term:`access token` provided in the WOPI request. Thus, these properties do not act as an authorization
mechanism. Rather, these properties help Office Online tailor its UI and behavior to the specific permissions a user
has. For example, Office Online will hide the file renaming UI if the :term:`UserCanRename` property is ``false``.
However, Office Online expects that even if that UI were somehow made available to a user without appropriate
permissions, the WOPI :ref:`RenameFile` request would fail since the host would determine the action was not
permissible based on the :term:`access token` passed in the request.

Note that there is no property that indicates the user has permission to read/view a file. This is because Office
Online expects that the host will respond to any WOPI request, including :ref:`CheckFileInfo`, with a
:http:statuscode:`404` if the access token is invalid or expired.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    ReadOnly
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that, for this user, the file cannot be changed.

    RestrictedWebViewOnly
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, will cause Office Online to hide any UI to download the
        file or to open it in another application.

    UserCanAttend
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the user has permission to view a :term:`broadcast` of this file.

    UserCanNotWriteRelative
        A **Boolean** value that indicates the user does not have sufficient permissions to create new files on the WOPI
        server. Setting this to ``true`` prevents Office Online from calling :ref:`PutRelativeFile` on behalf of the
        user.

    UserCanPresent
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the user has permission to :term:`broadcast` this file to a set of
        users who have permission to broadcast or view a broadcast of this file.

    UserCanRename
        A **Boolean** value that indicates the user has permission to rename the current file. Setting this to
        ``true`` enables Office Online to call :ref:`RenameFile` on behalf of the user. If set to ``false``,
        Office Online will hide UI related to renaming files.

    UserCanWrite
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that the user has permissions to alter the file. Setting this to ``true``
        enables Office Online to call :ref:`PutFile` on behalf of the user. In addition, Office Online will not load
        documents using the :wopi:action:`edit` action if this value is ``false`` for the user.

    WebEditingDisabled
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that Office Online must not allow the user to edit the file. This does not
        mean that the user doesn't have rights to edit the file.

PostMessage properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PostMessage properties control the behavior of Office Online with respect to incoming PostMessages. Note that if
you are using the PostMessage extensibility features of Office Online, you must set the :term:`PostMessageOrigin`
property to ensure that Office Online accepts messages from your outer frame. You can read more about PostMessage
integration at :ref:`PostMessage`.

In cases where a PostMessage is triggered by the user activating some Office Online UI, such as
:term:`FileSharingPostMessage` or :term:`EditModePostMessage`, Office Online will do nothing when the relevant UI is
activated except send the appropriate PostMessage. Thus, hosts must accept and handle the relevant messages when
the Office Online UI is triggered. Otherwise the Office Online UI will appear to do nothing when activated.

If the PostMessage API is not supported (e.g. the user's browser does not support it, or the browser security
settings prohibit it, etc.), Office Online UI that triggers a PostMessage will be hidden.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    ClosePostMessage
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, indicates the host expects to receive the :js:data:`UI_Close`
        PostMessage when the *Close* UI in Office Online is activated.

        Hosts can also use the :term:`CloseUrl` property to indicate that the outer frame should be navigated
        (``window.top.location``) when the *Close* UI is activated rather than sending a PostMessage, or set the
        :term:`CloseButtonClosesWindow` property to indicate that the *Close* UI should close the browser tab or
        window (``window.top.close``).

        If the :term:`CloseUrl`, :term:`ClosePostMessage`, and :term:`CloseButtonClosesWindow` properties are all
        omitted, the *Close* UI will be hidden in Office Online.

        ..  note:: The *Close* UI will never be displayed when using the :wopi:action:`embedview` action.

    EditModePostMessage
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, indicates the host expects to receive the :js:data:`UI_Edit`
        PostMessage when the *Edit* UI in Office Online is activated.

        If this property is not set to ``true``, Office Online will navigate the inner iframe URL to an edit action
        URL when the *Edit* UI is activated.

    EditNotificationPostMessage
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, indicates the host expects to receive the
        :js:data:`Edit_Notification` PostMessage.

    FileSharingPostMessage
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, indicates the host expects to receive the
        :js:data:`UI_Sharing` PostMessage when the *Share* UI in Office Online is activated.

        Hosts can also use the :term:`FileSharingUrl` property to indicate that a new browser window should be opened
        when the *Share* UI is activated rather than sending a PostMessage. Note that the :term:`FileSharingUrl`
        property will be ignored completely if the FileSharingPostMessage property is set to ``true``.

        If neither the :term:`FileSharingUrl` nor the :term:`FileSharingPostMessage` properties are set, the *Share*
        UI will be hidden in Office Online.

    PostMessageOrigin
        A **string** value indicating the domain the :term:`host page` will be sending/receiving PostMessages
        to/from. Office Online will only send outgoing PostMessages to this domain, and will only listen to
        PostMessages from this domain.

        ..  important::

            This value will be used as the *targetOrigin* when Office Online uses the
            `HTML5 Web Messaging protocol <http://www.w3.org/TR/webmessaging/>`_. Therefore, it must include the
            scheme and host name. If you are serving your pages on a non-standard port, you must include the port as
            well. The literal string ``*``, while supported in the PostMessage protocol, is not allowed by Office
            Online.

Breadcrumb properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Breadcrumb** properties determine what is displayed in the breadcrumb area within the Office Online UI.

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    BreadcrumbBrandName
        A **string** that Office Online will display to the user that indicates the brand name of the host.

    BreadcrumbBrandUrl
        A URI to a web page that Office Online will navigate to when the user clicks on UI that displays
        :term:`BreadcrumbBrandName`.

    BreadcrumbDocName
        A **string** that Office Online displays to the user that indicates the name of the file. If this is not
        provided, Office Online will use the :term:`BaseFileName` value.

    BreadcrumbDocUrl
        ..  deprecated:: 2014.06.01
            This property is now ignored by Office Online.

    BreadcrumbFolderName
        A **string** that Office Online will display to the user that indicates the name of the folder that contains
        the file.

    BreadcrumbFolderUrl
        A URI to a web page that Office Online will navigate to when the user clicks on UI that displays
        :term:`BreadcrumbFolderName`.

Other miscellaneous properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

..  glossary::
    :sorted:

    AllowExternalMarketplace
        A **Boolean** value that indicates Office Online may allow connections to external services referenced in
        the file (for example, a marketplace of embeddable JavaScript apps). If this value is ``false``, then
        Office Online will not allow such connections.

    CloseButtonClosesWindow
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, will cause Office Online to close the browser window or tab
        (``window.top.close``) when the *Close* UI in Office Online is activated.

        If Office Online displays an error dialog when booting, dismissing the dialog is treated as a close button
        activation with respect to this property.

        Hosts can also use the :term:`CloseUrl` property to indicate that the outer frame should be navigated
        (``window.top.location``) when the *Close* UI is activated rather than closing the browser tab or window, or
        set the :term:`ClosePostMessage` property to indicate a PostMessage should be sent when the *Close* UI is
        activated.

        If the :term:`CloseUrl`, :term:`ClosePostMessage`, and :term:`CloseButtonClosesWindow` properties are all
        omitted, the *Close* UI will be hidden in Office Online.

        ..  note:: The *Close* UI will never be displayed when using the :wopi:action:`embedview` action.

    DisableBrowserCachingOfUserContent
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, will cause Office Online to disable caching of file contents
        in the browser cache. Note that this has important performance implications. See :ref:`View performance` for
        more details.

    DisablePrint
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, will disable all print functionality provided by Office Online.

    DisableTranslation
        A **Boolean** value that, when set to ``true``, will disable all machine translation functionality provided by
        Office Online.

    FileExtension
        A **string** value representing the file extension for the file. This value must begin with a ``.``. If
        provided, Office Online will use this value as the file extension. Otherwise the extension will be parsed
        from the :term:`BaseFileName`.

        ..  tip::
            While this property is not required, we recommend that it be set rather than relying on the
            :term:`BaseFileName` parsing.

    FileNameMaxLength
        An **integer** value that indicates the maximum length for file names that the WOPI host supports, excluding
        the file extension. The default value is 250. Note that Office Online will use this default value if the
        property is omitted or if it is explicitly set to ``0``.

        This property is optional; however, hosts wishing to enable file renaming within Office Online should verify
        that the default value is appropriate and set it accordingly if not. See the :ref:`RenameFile` operation for
        more details.

    HostName
        A **string**, provided by the host, used to identify it. This property is not typically used since Office
        Online already identifies hosts based on the URLs of their WOPI endpoints. This value is only used for logging
        purposes.

    HostNotes
        A **string** that is used by the host to pass arbitrary information to Office Online. Office Online will
        ignore this string if it does not recognize its contents. A host must not require that Office Online
        understand the contents of this string to operate.

        ..  note:: |future|

    IrmPolicyDescription
        A **string** that Office Online will display to the user indicating the
        :abbr:`IRM (Information Rights Management)` policy for the file. This value should be combined with
        :term:`IrmPolicyTitle`.

    IrmPolicyTitle
        A **string** that the Office Online will display to the user indicating the :abbr:`IRM (Information Rights
        Management)` policy for the file. This value should be combined with :term:`IrmPolicyDescription`.

    PresenceProvider
        A **string** that identifies the provider of information that Office Online may use to discover
        information about the user's online status (for example, whether a user is available via instant messenger).
        Office Online requires knowledge of specific presence providers to be able to take advantage of this value.

    ProtectInClient
        A **Boolean** value that indicates that Office Online should take measures to prevent copying and printing of
        the file. This is intended to help enforce :abbr:`IRM (Information Rights Management)` in Office Online.

    SHA256
        A 256 bit SHA-2-encoded [`FIPS 180-2`_] hash of the file contents, as a Base64-encoded **string**. Used for
        caching purposes in Office Online. See :ref:`View performance` for more details.

    TimeZone
        A **string** that is used to pass time zone information to Office Online in a format chosen by the host.

    UniqueContentId
        |need_permission|

        In special cases, a host may choose to not provide a :term:`SHA256`, but still have some mechanism for
        identifying that two different files contain the same content in the same manner as the :term:`SHA256` is used.

        This **string** value can be provided rather than a :term:`SHA256` value, if the host can guarantee that two
        different files with the same content will have the same UniqueContentId value. See :ref:`View performance`
        for more details.
